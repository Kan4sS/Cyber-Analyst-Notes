This is a fantastic collection of notes! 
I've organized them into a structured and logical format that should make studying much easier. 
I've grouped related topics, used clear headings, and highlighted key terms. 
I've also put all your references in one clean, easy-to-find section at the end.

# Cybersecurity Intelligence

Types of Intelligence

    OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)

        Intelligence gathered from publicly available sources.
        Sources include alternative names, tools, and malware used, targeted organizations, motives, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

    HUMINT (Human Intelligence)

        Intelligence gathered from human sources.
        Requires understanding human behavior, emotions, and motivations.

    GEOINT (Geospatial Intelligence)

        Intelligence gathered from a geographic perspective (e.g., satellite imagery, aerial photos).
        Used in contexts like natural disasters, wartime, and political turmoil.

Key Concepts & Frameworks

    TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

        A high-level description of how a threat actor operates.

    MITRE ATT&CK Framework

        A knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
        Contains over 260 techniques split into 12 categories:

            Initial Access           Execution            Persistence            
            Privilege Escalation            Defense Evasion            Credential Access
            Discovery            Lateral Movement            Collection            
            Command and Control            Exfiltration            Impact

    Threat Intelligence Protocols

        TLP (Traffic Light Protocol): A standard for sharing sensitive information securely.
        PAP (Permissible Action Protocol): A protocol for defining what actions can be taken with shared information.

Digital Forensics

Core Concepts

    Data Representation

        Understanding different data formats is crucial for forensic investigations.
        Formats to know: Binary, Base64, Hexadecimal, Octal, and ASCII.

    Filesystems

        A set of data types used for data storage, categorization, management, navigation, and recovery.
        To view filesystems on Windows: Press Win + R and type diskmgmt.msc.

        Common Filesystem Types: FAT16, FAT32, NTFS, EXT3/EXT4.

Order of Volatility

    A list of evidence to be collected in a specific order, from most volatile to least volatile.

        Registers & Cache: Extremely volatile; data is constantly changing.

        Memory (RAM): Lost if power is disconnected; contains useful data about processes and connections.

        Disk (HDD and SSD): Data can be overwritten; less volatile than memory. SSDs have a risk of Garbage Collection/TRIM.

        Remote Logging and Monitoring Data: Less critical but still high volatility.

        Physical Configuration, Network Topology, Archival Media: Least volatile and less time-sensitive.

Forensic Tools & Techniques

    Chain of Custody

        A critical process for documenting the handling of evidence.

        Lack of proper documentation can lead to evidence being dismissed in court.

    Data Acquisition & Hashing

        Disk Imager: FTK Imager

        Hashing: Used to ensure the integrity of evidence.

            Windows: Get-FileHash <file>

            Linux: md5sum <file>, sha256sum <file>, sha1sum <file>

    Specialist Equipment

        Wireless Stronghold/Faraday Boxes: Block wireless signals to prevent remote wiping.

        Specialized Write-Blockers: Prevent data from being altered on a device.

        Phone Jammers: Similar to Faraday boxes.

        Dedicated Flash Drives: Contain forensic tools like Encase and FTK.

    Data Destruction Methods

        Degaussing, File Shredding, Physical Shredding, Hydraulic Crusher, Overwriting.

    Linux Command-Line Tools

        ls -lisap <file> and stat <file>: Get file metadata.

        exiftool <filename>: View metadata of files (e.g., author of a PDF, camera details of a JPG).

        scalpel: A file carving tool to recover deleted files.

            Example Usage: scalpel -c /etc/scalpel/scalpel.conf -o carved_images Carve1.img

        chown: Change file ownership.

        md5sum: Calculate the MD5 hash of a file.

Windows Artifact Analysis

    Tools:

        KAPE: Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor.

        Windows File Analyzer: A tool to view files in a human-readable format.

        PECmd.exe (Prefetch Explorer Command Line): To analyze Prefetch files.

        JumpList Explorer: To analyze Jump List files.

        Browser History Viewer: For analyzing web browser history.

        Browser History Capturer: For live acquisition of browser history.

    Artifact Locations:

        LNK Files: C:\Users\$USER$\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent

        Prefetch Files: C:\Windows\Prefetch

        Jump List Files: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations and ...CustomDestinations

    Browser Forensics (Live Acquisition):

        Look for artifacts like cookies, favorites, downloaded files, URLs visited, searches, and cached content.

Additional Files & Commands

    Pagefile.sys and hiberfil.sys: Windows system files that store temporary data.

    Linux Swap File:

        sudo fallocate -l [file size] /swapfile

        free -h: Check memory breakdown.

        swapon --show: Identify swap space.
